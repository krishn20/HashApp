# **HashApp**

* An app that hashes your data/text using Standard Hashing Algorithms (like SHA-256, SHA-512, MD5) and returns back the hashed value.
You can copy the value form the app and then paste and send it anywhere, to anyone.

* Animations and a good color scheme have been added as well, giving the app an overall good UI/UX experience.

_**Tasks to do -**_

* Create a similar based De-Hasher to convert back the hashed value.
* Add logic of automatically identifying which type of Hashing has been used and then converting and giving back relevant useful information/text.
* Add logic for more hashing algorithms.
* Add a Splash Screen.
* Create an apk source for other's to download the app.
* Add "Share" feature to send info+link for the app.
* Add entry-point-slides/info to tell about how the app works (3 page min.). This should only be displayed once i.e. the first time a user opens the app.
After that, this should be available in the Menu options which reruns it again but in an activity.
* Add Dev Info.
* _Optional_ - Add Login/OAuth functionality.
